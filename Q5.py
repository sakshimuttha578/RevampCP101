# Q5. Total Marks and Percentage
# Marks in 5 subjects: 78, 85, 67, 90, 82. Find total marks and percentage (assume each subject is out of 100).

m1, m2, m3 , m4, m5 = 78, 85, 67, 90, 82
total = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 + m5
percentage = (total/500)*100

print("Marks in 5 Subjects: 78, 85, 67, 90, 82")
print(f"Total = {total} / 500" )
print(f"Percentage = {percentage}" )
